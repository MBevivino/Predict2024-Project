This project aims to predict election outcomes by analyzing demographic trends, historical data, and polling data. It involves collecting extensive demographic data from the U.S. Census Bureau's API, covering variables such as population by age, race, ethnicity, educational attainment, and median household income, spanning from 2005 to 2019. Additionally, polling data is manually entered through a custom data entry script to further enhance the prediction models. By integrating this rich dataset with historical election results, the project seeks to build predictive models that provide insights into future elections
